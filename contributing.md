These are notes compiled for a third year Computer Science course. Hence, they are not a total representation of ASD - but rather a representation of the course's contents. That being said - if you feel I have left anything out, could have explained something better, made an error somewhere, or anything at all- please feel free to contribute to this repository.

## How To
Format your Markdown however you like, as long as it is readable and gets the point across 🏄 

## Environment
I generally write my notes in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), using the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension. It allows for a whole range of cool features. I then use [Emoji Sense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.emojisense) to ensure that my Emoji's work 👍

That being said, you do not have to use my environment  - I am simply letting you know what works for me. You can write markdown however you like! 😎
